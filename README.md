# S3 Logs Shipper

Yet another S3 logs shipper to Loki. Supports [ALB access logs](#how-it-works) and [MSK Connect worker logs](#kafkaconnect-logs). This one mostly targeted for an EKS use case where ALB is dynamically created by `aws-load-balancer-controller`

### How it works
- You have a S3 bucket [with permissions for ALB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/enable-access-logging.html#access-log-create-bucket) to write logs to
- You or mutation adds the following annotation to an Ingress object of alb ingressClass:  
`alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: access_logs.s3.enabled=true,access_logs.s3.bucket=<bucket-name>`
- ALB creates log files in the bucket in the format:  
  ```
  bucket[/prefix]/AWSLogs/aws-account-id/elasticloadbalancing/region/yyyy/mm/dd/aws-account-id_elasticloadbalancing_region_app.load-balancer-id_end-time_ip-address_random-string.log.gz
  ```
- `s3-logs-shipper` start to list all files from `--bucket-name` and process only those matching the pattern above
- Based on `aws-account-id` and `load-balancer-id` in the filename it lazily reads (and caches) tag `ingress.k8s.aws/stack` from the corresponding ALB to get `ingress` and `namespace` labels. These labels, along with static `stream=alb`, are added to the log stream. That is why such IAM permissions are required:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:s3:::${aws_s3_bucket.logs.id}",
          "arn:aws:s3:::${aws_s3_bucket.logs.id}/*"
        ]
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
          "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- The log.gz file is read from S3, unpacked on the fly, and then sent to Loki in batches of 100 lines. 429 and 5xx responses are retried with backoff. On success the file is deleted from S3. So no lifecycle is required on the S3 side, and the bucket would be empty under normal operation.
- After all files are processed, it waits `--wait=60s` and then scan for new files again. New log files appear in S3 with a delay of ~2m.

### Multicluster mode
It is possible to ship logs from ALB in aws account `A` to S3 bucket in account `B`. So, in multicluster multiaccount setup it is possible to have the same annotation in Ingress objects to ship logs to the single S3 bucket. Note that ALB only ships to bucket in the same region, so it is bucket-per-region.
- From log filename we can get source `account-id` and `loadbalancer-id`. But then, to get ALB tags, we need a list of IAM roles (`--role-arn`) to do `AssumeRole` for each account writing ALB logs to the bucket.
- Additional IAM permissions are required on `s3-logs-shipper` (S3 bucket) side:
  ```json
  {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- and on the ALB account side:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers",
          "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTags"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
  with Assume Role Policy:
  ```json
  {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<bucket-account-id>:role/<s3-logs-shipper-role>"},
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
      }]
  }
  ```
- Multiple clusters in the same account are distinguished by `cluster-id` tag on ALB. Which could be added by [--default-tags](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.5/deploy/configurations/#controller-command-line-flags) option of aws-load-balancer-controller.

### KafkaConnect logs
MSK Connect worker logs are detected by S3 key, so the same bucket could hold ALB and KafkaConnect logs of multiple clusters:
```
<cluster>/<namespace>/<connector>/AWSLogs/<account-id>/KafkaConnectLogs/<region>/<connector-uuid>/<YYYY>/<MM>/<DD>/<YYYYMMDD>T<HHMM>Z_<rand>.log.gz
```
- `cluster`, `namespace`, `connector` labels are taken from the key prefix (set by KafkaConnectController), plus static `stream=kcc`. No AWS API calls are needed
- Lines are shipped as is, without multiline merging, as multiple workers' lines are interleaved in the same file. Lines without timestamp (config dumps, stack traces) get the previous line timestamp +1ns, leading ones get the time from the filename
- With `--format=json` lines are shipped as `{"line":"<raw>"}`, otherwise as is
- Empty dir markers `.../AWSLogs/<account-id>/` are deleted

### Cli args
```bash
$ docker run sepa/s3-logs-shipper -h
Usage of ./s3-logs-shipper:
  -b, --bucket-name string     Name of the S3 bucket with ALB and/or KafkaConnect logs (required)
  -o, --format string          Format to parse and ship log lines as (logfmt, json, raw) (default "raw")
  -l, --label stringArray      Label to add to all Loki streams, overrides source labels, empty value removes the label, can be specified multiple times (key=value)
      --log-level string       Log level (info, debug) (default "info")
  -H, --loki-url string        URL to Loki API (required)
  -u, --loki-user string       User to use for Loki authentication
  -p, --port int               Port to expose metrics on (default 8080)
  -a, --role-arn stringArray   ARN of the IAM role to assume to access ALB tags, can be specified multiple times
  -v, --version                Show version and exit
  -w, --wait duration          Interval to wait between runs (default 1m0s)
  -n, --workers int            Number of workers to run (default 4)
```
And the password for Loki endpoint could be set via `LOKI_PASSWORD` env var.

### Log entries format

### Lambda mode  
There are pros and cons for running this as a lambda:
https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/tools/lambda-promtail/README.md  

pros:
- the latency of the latest logs delivery is lower, as we ship it immediately on write to S3
- on low-load buckets it might be cheaper to run it at 2x cpu/mem price in short bursts, than always working container at 0.3x spot price

cons:
- separate execution per-file means we cannot cache ALB tags between runs and would hit API for each file
- log files could be massive for loaded LB, and with retries time to process the file could? hit lambda execution limit (15m) 
- missed logs on non-delivered events, or on temporary problems with loki because no second lambda execution for old events would be done. Probably could be solved by SQS with ACK, or additional cron lambda which processes the whole bucket.

### RegExp is slow
Here is a comparison of regexp (as in `lambda-promtail`) and custom parsing:
```bash
$ make bench 
BenchmarkLineRegex_AsLogfmt-16             42078             28971 ns/op            2616 B/op         18 allocs/op
BenchmarkLineRegex_AsJson-16               41798             28651 ns/op            2419 B/op         15 allocs/op
BenchmarkLineSlice_AsLogfmt-16            496107              2536 ns/op            2584 B/op         22 allocs/op
BenchmarkLineSlice_AsJson-16              414213              2915 ns/op            2392 B/op         19 allocs/op
PASS
ok      github.com/sepich/s3-logs-shipper      5.159s
```

### TODO
- The tag `ingress.k8s.aws/stack` is set to `namespace/ingressname` only for an implicit IngressGroup. When the IngressGroup is set on Ingress, there is no way to get ns/ingressname. Dynamic placeholders are not supported in `--default-tags` of alb controller. Need to use mutation for Ingress objects adding `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags` annotation with ns/ingressname.
- When alb-ingress is deleted, ALB is removed and then final logs appear later in S3. At this point, the shipper should use cached info to set the correct labels for logs. If the shipper was restarted after ALB is removed and before logs appear in S3, it has no way to get ALB tags anymore. To prevent data loss, it would exit with error instead of deleting the non-shipped logs. In this case, files should be reviewed and deleted manually:
  ```
  level=error caller=parser.go:100 msg="failed to ship file" key=AWSLogs/1234567890/elasticloadbalancing/eu-central-1/2025/05/30/1234567890_elasticloadbalancing_eu-central-1_app.loadbalancer-id.614c0546c583b475_20250530T0825Z_10.1.1.1_4qhkaho9.log.gz err="failed to get metadata for load balancer 1234567890/loadbalancer-id: operation error Elastic Load Balancing v2: DescribeLoadBalancers, https response error StatusCode: 400, RequestID: b8e6c668-8209-420e-8941-22b66ff2e9b7, LoadBalancerNotFound: Load balancers '[loadbalancer-id]' not found"
  ```
  Add some `--drop-unknown-files` flag and handle `LoadBalancerNotFound` error automatically?
